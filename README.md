## Building and Running

Each lab contains its own main program. To compile and run a specific lab:

```bash
cd [lab_directory]
g++ *.cpp -o program
./program
```
## Requirements
- C++ compiler (g++ recommended)
- Python 3.x (for visualization scripts)
- Plotting libraries for Python (matplotlib, pandas)

## Documentation
Each implementation includes:

- Header files (.h) with class/function declarations
- Source files (.cpp) with implementations
- Test programs (main.cpp)
- Where applicable, performance analysis scripts and data
